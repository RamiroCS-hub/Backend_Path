## ARCHITECTURES
The architectures in software is a general idea to solve some problem. Is not like de programming patterns that are specific solutions, the architectures are only a concept to facilitate the coding of some solution to a general problem

#### MICROSERVICES
The microservices architecture organize the software into little services that work independently from each other. The idea is to reduce the time of communication, codging and complexity of the project. Focusing in having teams that focus in one service. The services comunicate with the others between HTTP and HTTPS and they are usually deployed in Docker containers in the same VM to make the comunication between the services fast.
