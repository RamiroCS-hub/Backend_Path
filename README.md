## THIS IS MY BACKEND PATH

### What is the backend path?
I call backend path to this repository. I will put here all the information that I will be learning to have a super useful database of backend information. I will follow the path of roadmad.sh (https://roadmap.sh/backend) starting where I think I am right now (2024-08-02 - ISO STANDARD DATE). In every new topic I will add a new folder containing all the information and projects related to that.
  I hope someone find this useful for their carreer!
